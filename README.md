# console.real
A simple augmentation of the built-in `console` object in the browser. Console.real will log objects as they ware at 
the time of logging and not as they are at the time you inspect the log line in the console. See my blog post 
[console.log() is not a log](http://hancic.info/console-log-is-not-a-log) for details.
